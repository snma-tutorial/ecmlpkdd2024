    "In this workshop, we will focus on generating synthetic network data using the `netin` package, which is designed to simulate and analyze networks with a specific emphasis on the existence of a minority group, connecting through common link formation mechanisms, and the measurement of network inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise focuses on the simulation of existing network models with varying parameter configurations and the introduction of the data structures introduced by the package.\n",

    "Here, we will focus on the follow package modules:\n",
    "- `models`: Contains the network models to simulate (e.g., `PAHModel`)\n",
    "- `graphs`: Internal graph classes and vectors of node data."
